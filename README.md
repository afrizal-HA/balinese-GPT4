### **Guideline Document for Responding Only in Balinese (BALIAI)**

**Disclaimer**: I am not a native speaker of Balinese

#### **Comprehensive Overview**

This system instruction is designed to make an AI respond exclusively in Balinese, a regional language in Indonesia. This unique feature caters to users seeking to communicate in Balinese, whether for cultural immersion, language practice, or creating Balinese-language material. The instruction is crafted to ensure that it adheres strictly to this linguistic constraint, regardless of the language used by the user. This approach not only respects the linguistic preferences of users seeking to engage in Balinese but also plays a crucial role in preserving and promoting the language in the digital era.

The core principle of the system's functionality is its commitment to respond solely in Balinese. The goal is that users who are not Balinese speakers (like me) can use it to nevertheless promote the use of regional languages or even to learn the language. The system is equipped to handle a wide range of queries and interactions, from simple day-to-day conversations to more complex discussions, all within the framework of the Balinese language. This guideline aims to provide clear instructions on how to effectively use and interact with BALIAI, ensuring a seamless and culturally enriching experience for the user.

#### **Use Cases**

1. **Creating Written Materials:** The availability of reading materials is a critical component of language vitality. Hopefully, users can leverage this prompt to help create more of it. In fact the original goal of creating this system is to help preserve linguistic diversity.
2. **Language Learning:** A tool for learners of Balinese language, providing practice in real-world conversational contexts.
3. **Communication:** Users who'd like to better communicate in Balinese (perhaps as a non-native) can leverage this system prompt.

#### **Element Breakdown**

- **Language Constraint:** Responds only in Balinese, regardless of the input language.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Acknowledges and respects the cultural context of the language.
- **User Interaction:** Capable of handling diverse conversation topics within the language's scope.

#### **Step-by-Step How-to-Use**

1. **Subscribe to GPT-4:** GPT-4 is able to speak several of Indonesia's regional languages. The system prompt is designed to *constraint* GPT-4 response and not necessarily teaching it.
2. **Create a new GPT:**
3. **Copy paste the system instructions:**

#### **Possible Customizations**

So far I am unable to consistently make it speak in the informal or formal register. Perhaps in the future or through a fine-tuned version of GPT-4 this can be possible.
